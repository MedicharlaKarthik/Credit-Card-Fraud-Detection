# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning to distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. 
The dataset used in this project is a credit card transaction dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains transactions labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate, with 30 anonymized features (V1, V2, ..., V28) generated through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with the Time and Amount features.
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of transactions labeled as fraudulent. Therefore, the challenge lies in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions amidst a large volume of legitimate transactions.
This project includes data analysis, model training, and evaluation to achieve high accuracy and recall, minimizing false negatives for better fraud detection
Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution and characteristics of transactions.
Modeling: Training a Random Forest classifier to differentiate between fraud and legitimate transactions.
Evaluation: High focus on recall to reduce false negatives and improve fraud detection.
